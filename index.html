          <h3>Playing Style</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Williams is primarily a baseline player, and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game, as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a "high risk" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which most say is the greatest in women's tennis history.</p>
        <p>Williams is known for producing exceptional comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level. Williams has bounced back from a set down to win in 37 Grand Slam matches.</p>
        <p>She has stated that her favorite surface is clay because it gives her extra time to set up her shots.</p>
